Ello! I’m 'JustAundre'
I take an interest in coding, art, online video creation, and overall lots of tech-related things!
I’m currently learning Javascript since I heard it can do a lot of special things.
You can contact me via my Discord ("justaundre")
I'm a he/him, but of course, I'll accept they/them pronouns.
